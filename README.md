- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @etinney, a postdoctoral researcher at NSF NCAR. I earned my B.S. in Meteorology from Central Michigan University in 2018
and my M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma in 2020 and 2023.
- ðŸ‘€ My work primarily focuses on (1) upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) composition and dynamics and (2) climate and convection interacations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently switching from IDL to python as my primary programming language, so I'm trying to learn all that I can.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - etinney@ucar.edu
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have two amazing kitties - Gizmo (17 yo) and Leia (6 yo).
